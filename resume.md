Professional Summary
--------------------

Throughout my 20 year career I have developed my ability to dissect
and resolve complex functional and technical
issues. Â My "lead by example" approach makes me an effective technical leader and team builder. I am an efficient communicator and technology evangelist capable of bridging communication gaps among senior leadership, technical engineers and non-technical stakeholder. I am a subscriber to DevOps best practices, and a believer in the benefits of coupling infrastructure as code with cloud-native architectures. I have been developing horizontally scalable distributed systems since 1999 and am currently using my experience to leverage technologies to solve real world business problems.
