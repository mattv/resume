Copied 2 resume styles from the following repositories...

Credit to [this](https://github.com/mszep/pandoc_resume) repository for a less space efficient resume.  This one also does not do word format so well.
Credit to [this](https://github.com/jacksenechal/resume) repository for a more space efficient resume.  This one does a better job producing the word format.

To produce the less space efficient resume run make and look in the output folder.

To produce a more space efficient resume run publish and look in the root folder for the artifacts.

TODO: setup git hub actions to generate pdf/html formats on change.
