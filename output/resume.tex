\subsection[title={Professional
Summary},reference={professional-summary}]

Motivated and seasoned technologist with a broad professional
background.~ Proven ability to dissect and resolve complex business
problems.~ Practitioner of continuous improvement best practices.~
Strong technical leader with a belief in the power of leading by
example. Collaborative team builder capable of relating to senior
leadership, technical engineers and non-technical stakeholders alike.

{\em Software engineer with strong people and management skills, seeking
a lead developer or engineering manager role.}

As an engineer I care deeply about quality and precision, not only at
the code level but throughout the product. I balance attention to detail
with a drive to ship, because a product is only as good as its
usefulness to actual people. I enjoy creating lucid user experiences and
designing robust software architectures.

As a team leader I bring empathy, solidity, and clarity of
communication. I enjoy optimizing processes and refining infrastructure
so teams are faced with minimal repetitive load and can focus on
high-flying creativity.

I seek a vibrant environment of innovation, a strong team practicing
Agile methodologies, and a culture of excellence. It is more than a day
job, it is a platform to make a meaningful contribution at a global
scale.
